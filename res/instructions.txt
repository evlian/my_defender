INSTRUCTIONS

Defend  your  castle  against  enemies  by  deploying  towers!

Simply  select  a  tower  from  the  tower  selector  and  deploy  it
near  the  path  where  the  enemy  will  pass.

Every  tower  costs,  so  you  will  have  to  earn  coins  by  killing
as  many  enemies  as  you  can!

Notice  the  towers'  attacking  ranges  when  you  deploy  them,
which  tells  you  how  far  a  tower  can  detect  and  attack  enemies.

The  enemies  are  endless,  which  means  you  will  have  to  defend  for
as  long  as  you  can!
